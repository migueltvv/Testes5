================================= Dataset Remarks ===========================================

- During the experiment it was performed 2 trials with 1 closed-loop lap, with diferent positions of the ranger front tool
- Spread In the scenario you can find 5 April tags (17x17cm), with different IDs {0,2,3,4,5}
- AprilTags were mapped with GPS coordinates, please check "2021_11_11_april_tags_groundtruth_survey" folder
- The GPS RTK base station datum can be found "2021_11_11_gps_base_station_datum.txt"
- Dynamic tf from camera_tool is not completly adjusted yet
- Static tfs from camera_back_right/left is not completly adjusted yet
- Radar pcl threshold was define to  
- There are some data glitches during the experiment, please check rosbag_glitches.png


================================= INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================================

1) Download the sensor data datasets "2022_04_04_ranger_trial_X.zip" (2 trials) from:
https://home.mycloud.com/action/share/ae53be9c-e989-4d5b-9ee5-39bcddff5e18


2) Clone two packages to your ROS catkin workspace, by running the following commands:
 cd ~/catkin_ws/src
 git clone https://gitlab.ingeniarius.pt/ingeniarius_public/semfire/ranger/lslidar_c16.git
 copy ranger_datasets rospackage


3) Decompress the main dataset (21.5 GB) with the following comand in separated terminals :
 "unzip 2022_04_04_ranger_trial1.zip -d ~/catkin_ws/src/ranger_datasets/dataset/"
 "unzip 2022_04_04_ranger_trial2.zip -d ~/catkin_ws/src/ranger_datasets/dataset/"
 
 Note: Leave the decompression running - it will take a long time - on the background and move on to steps 4-6).

4) install the lslidar decoder pkg (to allow for LIDAR pointcloud visualization) dependencies with this command:
sudo apt install ros-melodic-angles ros-melodic-pcl-ros ros-melodic-diagnostic-updater ros-melodic-eigen-conversions

5) install the dataset runtime dependencies with this command:
sudo apt install ros-melodic-image-transport ros-melodic-image-transport-plugins ros-melodic-depth-image-proc ros-melodic-tf2-tools

6) Now compile your ROS workspace with these commands:
 cd ~/catkin_ws
 catkin_make or catkin build

7) after 3) is finished, please verify that you placed *all the downloaded datasets* inside the folder "ranger_datasets/dataset"

8) run the dataset with the command:
  "roslaunch ranger_datasets play_dataset_2022_04_04.launch" (for publishing sensor raw data)
  Note: If your PC is running slow, you can try lowering the dataset rate e.g. "0.5"
